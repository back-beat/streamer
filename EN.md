## Brief
Hello dear streamers, we are honored to present you the Backbeat Windows app. The Backbeat app allows you to broadcast your actual playing song informations to our server.

**Please read carefully this documentation, you can ask us more questions on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/backbeat_ext). But if the questions are in the FAQ we won't respond, as simple as that.**

### How it works ?
The application gets the informations about the current playing song, it sends this informations to our server. When a new viewer wants to listen to the music, he asks to the server and he receives the informations of the song. When you change the song, pause... the server sends the information to the viewers.

### How the viewers can listen to music without violating the DMCA ?
The platforms actually on the application offer to create customized players to play music with their service. So for the beneficiary of the music, they only see several users listenning to the same music at the same time. So it generates streams for artists and an important streamer can increasse extremely the artist streams.

## Precautions
*Here are some precautions to apply to avoid bugs*

---

* Don't use shortcuts to control music
* When they are multiple ways to control the music use the most logical way (we surely forgot some)
* If you use YouTube avoid the clips prefer the automatic generated audios, avoid too the songs with channel's name different from the artist name (ex: vevo, official, topic)
* Essayez d'intéragir avec l'application régulièrement pour éviter le délai trop important
* Use the music as a background not as a main feature: the delay could not correspond depending on your connection, viewer's connection, server's connection, if the servers are overloaded it could harm to user's experience
* Add to your stream a sign displaying the current song played so the viewers can know if they have too much delay to resync music.
